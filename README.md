### About the Slice Scout Team

Slice Scout was created by a group of NYC-based college students who share a deep love for 99¢ pizza. Our mission is simple: to help New Yorkers find affordable, authentic slices amidst rising prices while preserving this cherished tradition for generations to come.

### Our Story

Slice Scout was inspired by the cheap pizza purge NYC experienced after COVID-19 and inflation. As students at CUNY, we've relied on 99¢ pizza to get through tight budgets and late-night study sessions. We saw the need to create a resource for finding traditional 99¢ slices amidst rising prices and the confusion caused by misleading shop names. Thus, we created this app to allow people to find cheap pizza easily by using crowd-sourced data directly from consumers.
